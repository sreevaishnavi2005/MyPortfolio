            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Sree Vaishnavi, a third-year B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at KLU. With a deep passion for technology and innovation, I am dedicated to honing my skills in web development and software engineering. Over the past few years, I have gained practical experience through various projects and internships, developing a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern web technologies.

                I am particularly interested in creating user-friendly and responsive web applications that address real-world problems. My coursework and hands-on projects have equipped me with a strong understanding of the software development lifecycle, from initial design to deployment. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working in teams to bring creative solutions to life.
                
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, participating in hackathons, or contributing to open-source projects. I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills.
                
                Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I have worked on and learn more about my journey in the tech world. If you'd like to get in touch, don't hesitate to reach out through the contact section below.</p>
